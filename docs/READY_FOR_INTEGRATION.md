##  BLAKE'S ACTION PLAN

### Priority Order:
1. **Galileo** (15 min) - Most critical for quality scoring
2. **Neo4j** (10 min) - Needed for RAG storage
3. **Browser Use** (5 min) - Just pip install
4. **WorkOS** (10 min) - Authentication
5. **Daytona** (15 min) - Workspace integration

**Total Time**: ~55 minutes

### What to Send Me:
Once you have the keys, paste this into chat:

```
GALILEO_API_KEY=<your-key>
NEO4J_URI=<your-uri>
NEO4J_USER=<your-user>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-password>
WORKOS_API_KEY=<your-key>
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=<your-id>
DAYTONA_API_KEY=<your-key>

##  WHAT I'LL DO ONCE I HAVE KEYS

### Immediate (30 min):
1.  Update .env file with all keys
2.  Install galileo-observe package
3.  Install browser-use package
4.  Test Galileo connection
5.  Test Neo4j connection

### Integration (2-3 hours):
6.  Integrate Galileo Observe SDK (remove simplified scoring)
7.  Create Neo4j RAG client
8.  Create Browser Use doc scraper
9.  Create WorkOS authentication
10.  Create Daytona workspace client

### Testing (1 hour):
11.  Test each integration independently
12.  Test full 4-agent workflow with all services
13.  Validate 90+ quality threshold works
14.  Test error handling

##  CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working:
-  OpenRouter (Claude, GPT-5, Grok)
-  All agent code
-  LangGraph workflow
-  Basic tests passing

### What's Blocked:
-  Galileo (no API key)
-  Neo4j (no credentials)
-  Browser Use (not installed)
-  WorkOS (no API key)
-  Daytona (no API key)

### Current Test Status:
- Tests are still running (using old mock code)
- Once you provide keys, I'll retest with REAL integrations

- [ ] All 5 API keys provided
- [ ] All packages installed
- [ ] All services integrated
- [ ] Full workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] No mock code anywhere
- [ ] Quality scores from real Galileo
- [ ] RAG working with Neo4j

## ⏰ TIMELINE ESTIMATE

**If Blake starts now:**
- Blake setup: 55 min (parallel tasks)
- Claude integration: 3.5 hours
- Testing: 1 hour
- **Total to demo-ready**: ~5-6 hours

**Critical Path:**
- Galileo is most important (15 min)
- Neo4j is second (10 min)
- Others can happen in parallel

##  NEXT STEPS

### Blake:
1. Open [COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md](cci:1://file:///Users/bledden/Documents/codeswarm/COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md:0:0-0:0)
2. Follow each section in order
3. Copy credentials as you get them
4. Paste all credentials to Claude when done

### Claude (waiting):
1. ⏳ Waiting for API keys
2.  Preparing integration code
3.  Writing integration plans
4.  Ready to code as soon as keys arrive
