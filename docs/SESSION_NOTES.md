# Session Notes - 2025-10-21

## Potential Data Loss Warning

**File**: `src/integrations/daytona_client.py`
**Action**: Reverted experimental changes via `git checkout`
**Risk**: Unknown if there were uncommitted in-session changes before experimental edits

**Context**:
- Made experimental changes to implement Daytona sessions/nohup
- Reverted to HEAD (commit d0c3ced) to remove experiments
- Session summary didn't list daytona_client.py as modified
- But can't verify 100% that no important changes were lost

**If Issues Arise**:
1. Check if Daytona deployments are working as they were before
2. Look for file upload issues, SDK connection problems, or command execution failures
3. The last known good commit: `d0c3ced - fix: Three critical deployment fixes`
4. Previous working features:
   - ‚úÖ Workspace creation
   - ‚úÖ File uploads via SDK
   - ‚úÖ Command execution (with expected timeout for servers)
   - ‚úÖ Preview URL generation
   - ‚ùå URLs accessible (this was the original issue)

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Test basic deployment still works
python3.11 codeswarm.py --task "create a simple hello world website"

# Check if files upload successfully
# Check if workspace is created
# Check if command executes (even if it times out)
```

## Work Completed This Session

### ‚úÖ Galileo Investigation
- **Status**: Complete - code works, UI doesn't (Galileo side issue)
- **Files**: docs/GALILEO_INVESTIGATION_RESULTS.md, test_galileo_*.py
- **Decision**: Skip Galileo UI in demos, use Weave instead

### ‚úÖ Phase Status Documentation
- **File**: docs/PHASE_STATUS_SUMMARY.md
- **Phases**:
  - Phase 1 (Caching): ‚úÖ Complete
  - Phase 2 (Doc Effectiveness): ‚úÖ Complete
  - Phase 3 (Semantic Search): ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (method exists, not integrated)
  - Phase 4 (Feedback Loop): ‚úÖ Complete
  - Phase 5 (GitHub): üìã Designed only

### ‚è≥ Daytona URL Investigation
- **Status**: Investigation complete, fix pending
- **File**: docs/DAYTONA_URL_INVESTIGATION.md
- **Issue**: URLs return "no IP address" error
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. Use Daytona sessions API (if exists)
  2. Use nohup wrapper (fallback)
  3. Add health checks (band-aid)

### ‚è≥ Phase 3 Integration
- **Status**: Not started
- **Work**: Integrate `get_proven_docs_for_task()` into workflow
- **Impact**: Expected 20% quality improvement

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Daytona URL** - Critical for website deployments
2. **Complete Phase 3** - 30 min task, significant quality boost
3. **End-to-end testing** - Validate all phases working together
