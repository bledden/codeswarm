# Vision Model Implementation Status

## YES - Vision Model is Fully Implemented!

You can absolutely pass a photo of a landing page drawn on paper and have CodeSwarm generate code from it.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Vision Agent
**File**: [src/agents/vision_agent.py](../src/agents/vision_agent.py)

**Model**: `gpt-5-image` (OpenAI GPT-5 with vision capabilities)

**Capabilities**:
- Analyzes sketches, mockups, and screenshots
- Extracts UI components and layout structure
- Identifies design patterns and interactions
- Converts visual designs to technical specifications
- Provides detailed analysis for other agents

**Key Features**:
```python
# Accepts image files
async def analyze_image(
    image_path: str,      # Path to your sketch photo
    task: str,            # Description of what to build
    context: Dict[str, Any],
    quality_threshold: float = 90.0,
    max_iterations: int = 2
) -> AgentOutput
```

**What It Analyzes**:
1. Layout Structure (header, main, sidebar, footer, grid system)
2. UI Components (buttons, inputs, cards, navbars, etc.)
3. Visual Design (colors, typography, icons, spacing)
4. Interactions (clicks, forms, navigation flows)
5. Technical Recommendations (React/Vue, libraries, responsive design)
6. Implementation Priority (what to build first)

---

### 2. LangGraph Workflow Integration
**File**: [src/orchestration/workflow.py](../src/orchestration/workflow.py)

The vision agent is integrated into the workflow:

```
User Request → RAG Retrieval → Vision Analysis (if image) → Architecture → Implementation + Security → Testing → Synthesis
```

**Conditional Activation**: Vision analysis automatically triggers when:
- Image path is provided: `context.get("image_path")`
- Visual keywords detected: "sketch", "mockup", "screenshot", "design", "wireframe", etc.

---

### 3. Demo Script Ready
**File**: [demo/demo.py](../demo/demo.py)

Fully functional demo that accepts image input:

```bash
# Run with sketch image
python3 demo.py path/to/sketch.jpg

# Run without image (text-only mode)
python3 demo.py
```

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Take photo of paper sketch
python3 demo.py ~/Photos/landing_page_sketch.jpg

# The system will:
# 1. Analyze the sketch with GPT-5-image
# 2. Extract layout, components, colors, interactions
# 3. Generate architecture based on vision analysis
# 4. Implement the code
# 5. Add security and tests
# 6. Output production-ready code
```

---

## How to Use Vision Model

### Step 1: Create Your Sketch
Draw a landing page on paper showing:
- Layout structure (header, hero, features, footer)
- UI components (buttons, forms, cards)
- Text labels and content
- Any specific design elements

### Step 2: Take a Clear Photo
- Good lighting
- In focus
- Straight-on angle (not too tilted)
- High enough resolution to read text

Supported formats: JPG, PNG, JPEG, WEBP

### Step 3: Run Demo with Image
```bash
python3 demo.py path/to/your/sketch.jpg
```

### Step 4: Review Generated Code
The vision agent will:
1. Analyze your sketch (extracting layout, components, colors)
2. Provide technical specification to other agents
3. Guide architecture design based on visual analysis
4. Result in code that matches your sketch

Output saved to: `demo_output/`

## Technical Architecture

### Image Processing Flow

```
User Photo (JPEG/PNG)
    ↓
Base64 Encoding (vision_agent.py:190-204)
    ↓
OpenRouter API Call with Image
    ↓
GPT-5-image Vision Model
    ↓
Technical Specification (layout, components, design)
    ↓
Shared with All Agents via CodeSwarmState
    ↓
Architecture Agent (designs based on vision analysis)
    ↓
Implementation Agent (codes based on vision + architecture)
    ↓
Production-ready Code Matching Your Sketch
```

### Vision Agent Output Example

When you provide a sketch, the vision agent returns:

```markdown
# Technical Specification from Sketch

## Layout Structure
- Header: Logo left, navigation right (Home, Features, Pricing, Contact)
- Hero Section: Centered text, 2 CTA buttons, hero image
- Features: 3-column grid with icon cards
- Pricing: 3 pricing tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Contact Form: Name, Email, Message fields
- Footer: Copyright, links, social icons

## UI Components
- Navigation bar (sticky)
- Hero headline (h1, 48px)
- Primary button (blue, rounded)
- Secondary button (outlined)
- Feature cards (border, padding, icon)
- Pricing cards (highlighted middle tier)
- Form inputs (text, email, textarea)
- Submit button

## Visual Design
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Background: #FFFFFF (white)
- Text: #1F2937 (dark gray)
- Typography: Sans-serif, clean
- Spacing: Generous padding, 80px sections

## Technical Recommendations
- Framework: React with TailwindCSS
- Components: Navbar, Hero, FeatureGrid, PricingCards, ContactForm
- Responsive: Mobile-first, breakpoints at 768px, 1024px
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
```

This specification then guides all other agents!

## Real-World Example

### Input: Hand-drawn Landing Page Sketch
```
Photo of paper with:
- Header with logo and nav
- Big headline "Welcome to SaaS Product"
- Two buttons
- 3 feature boxes
- Pricing table
- Contact form
```

### Output: Production Code
```typescript
// Auto-generated from your sketch!

import React from 'react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-white">
