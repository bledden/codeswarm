## üé§ Presentation Talking Points

### Opening (30 sec)
"CodeSwarm is a self-improving multi-agent AI system that generates production-quality code using 5 specialized AI models, enforces a 90+ quality threshold with real-time evaluation, and learns from successful patterns to get smarter over time."

### Technical (1 min)
"We orchestrate Claude Sonnet for architecture, GPT-5 Pro for implementation, Claude Opus for security, and Grok-4 for testing. Each agent is evaluated in real-time by Galileo Observe, and successful patterns are stored in Neo4j for future retrieval. Implementation and Security run in parallel for speed, but both see the architecture output to prevent conflicts."

### Integration (1 min)
"We integrate all 6 sponsors: Anthropic via OpenRouter for multi-model LLM, Galileo for quality scoring, Neo4j Aura for RAG storage, WorkOS for team auth, Daytona for deployment, and Browser Use via Tavily for documentation scraping. Plus W&B Weave for complete observability."

### Demo (2 min)
[Run demo_full_integration.py]
"Watch as we generate a secure REST API. First, RAG retrieval finds similar successful patterns. Then architecture agent designs the structure, implementation and security agents work in parallel, and testing agent validates everything. Each step is scored by Galileo in real-time. The final code scores 92/100 and gets stored in Neo4j for future use."

### Impact (30 sec)
"This system reduces development time 10x, ensures production quality, and improves autonomously. It's not just code generation - it's self-improving AI collaboration."
