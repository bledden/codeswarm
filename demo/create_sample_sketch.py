## Option 1: Use This Text Description (NO IMAGE NEEDED)

You can run the demo WITHOUT an image by providing this detailed description:

```
Create a modern SaaS landing page with:

1. Header:
   - Logo on left
   - Navigation: Home, Features, Pricing, Contact

2. Hero Section:
   - Large headline: "Welcome to Our SaaS Product"
   - Subheading: "The best solution for your business needs"
   - Two CTAs: "Get Started" (primary) and "Learn More" (secondary)
   - Hero image placeholder

3. Features Section:
   - Title: "Features"
   - 3 feature cards in a row:
     - Each with icon, title, and description
     - Cards have borders and padding

4. Pricing Section:
   - Title: "Pricing"
   - 3 pricing tiers:
     - Basic: $9/mo
     - Pro: $29/mo (highlighted)
     - Enterprise: $99/mo
   - Each with a "Choose Plan" button

5. Contact Form:
   - Title: "Contact Us"
   - Fields: Name, Email, Message
   - Submit button

6. Footer:
   - Copyright notice
   - Links: Privacy, Terms
   - Social media icons

Color scheme: Blue primary, white background, dark text
```

Run demo with: `python3 demo.py` (no image needed)

## Option 2: Create a Quick Digital Sketch

### Using Excalidraw (Recommended - Free)
1. Go to https://excalidraw.com
2. Draw boxes for each section above
3. Add labels and text
4. Export as PNG
5. Save as `demo/sketch.jpg`

### Using Figma (If you have it)
1. Create new file
2. Add rectangles for sections
3. Add text labels
4. Export as PNG
5. Save as `demo/sketch.jpg`

### Using Photos (Hand-drawn)
1. Draw the wireframe on paper following the layout above
2. Take a clear photo with your phone
3. Make sure it's well-lit and in focus
4. Transfer to computer
5. Save as `demo/sketch.jpg`

---

## Option 3: Use Placeholder Image

We've included a text wireframe in `demo/wireframe.txt` that describes the layout.
The Vision agent can work with text descriptions if no image is available.

---

## Testing Without Image

The demo works perfectly WITHOUT an image:

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

The system will skip vision analysis and proceed with text-only mode.
This is actually fine for the hackathon demo!
