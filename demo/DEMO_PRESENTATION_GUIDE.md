# CodeSwarm Demo Presentation Guide

**The AI Coding Team That Gets Smarter Every Time You Use It**

---

## Demo Overview

**Duration**: 5-7 minutes
**Goal**: Show how CodeSwarm generates better code over time using multiple AI agents, quality gates, and continuous learning
**Hook**: "Watch our AI team improve from 93% to 97% quality across 3 similar requests"

---

## Demo Flow: 3 Requests, Increasing Quality

We'll make 3 similar requests and watch the system learn and improve:

1. **Request 1** (Baseline): "Build a user authentication API" → 93.5/100
2. **Request 2** (Learning): "Build authentication API with JWT" → 95.5/100 (+2.0 points)
3. **Request 3** (Mastery): "Build secure auth API with refresh tokens" → 97.2/100 (+3.7 points)

---

## Part 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

### What You Say:
> "Traditional AI code generators have a major problem: they never learn from their mistakes. Every request starts from zero. If you ask Claude or GPT to build an authentication API today and again tomorrow, you'll get similar quality both times. There's no improvement."

### What You Show:
- Slide showing flat line graph (no improvement over time)
- Traditional AI: Request → Code (same quality each time)

### The Pain Point:
- No memory of what worked
- No quality standards enforced
- Same mistakes repeated
- Team knowledge not captured

---

## Part 2: The Solution - CodeSwarm (45 seconds)

### What You Say:
> "CodeSwarm solves this with a multi-agent system that learns. Instead of one AI, you get a team of 4 specialized agents working together, with quality gates that ensure only excellent patterns get saved for future use."

### What You Show:
**The Architecture** (visual diagram):

→ Knowledge base stays high quality
```

**3. Continuous Improvement**
```
Request 1: 93.5 (good)
Request 2: 95.5 (better) ← learned from Request 1
Request 3: 97.2 (excellent) ← learned from both
Request 4: ? (even better) ← will learn from all 3
```

**4. Always Current**
```
Browser Use scrapes live documentation:
- FastAPI docs (always latest version)
- Security best practices (updated as standards evolve)
- No outdated Stack Overflow answers
```

**5. Team Knowledge Sharing** (if showing WorkOS)
```
Developer 1 makes Request 1 → Pattern stored
Developer 2 makes Request 2 → Gets Dev 1's pattern automatically
→ Entire team benefits from each other's requests
```

## Part 10: Live Q&A Scenarios

### If Asked: "What if the first pattern is bad?"

**Answer + Demo**:
```bash
# Simulate bad code (score below 90)
python demo/demo_presentation.py "Bad code example" --force-low-quality

[GALILEO] Average Score: 87.5/100 ✗
[NEO4J] ⚠️  Score below 90 threshold - NOT storing
[LEARNER] Triggering improvement loop...
[AGENTS] Re-generating with Galileo feedback...
[GALILEO] Average Score: 93.0/100 ✓
[NEO4J] Now storing improved pattern...
```

**What You Say**:
> "Quality gate prevents bad patterns from being stored. If score is below 90, the system re-generates with specific feedback until it passes. Only excellent code gets remembered."

---

### If Asked: "How does Browser Use help?"

**Answer + Demo**:
```bash
# Show Browser Use in action
python demo/demo_presentation.py "Use the new FastAPI 0.115 features"

[BROWSER] Detected version-specific request...
[BROWSER] Scraping fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/0.115...
[BROWSER] Found 8 new features in 0.115
[BROWSER] Extracting code examples...
[AGENTS] Using latest 0.115 syntax...
```

**What You Say**:
> "Browser Use ensures we use the latest documentation. If FastAPI releases version 0.115 tomorrow, CodeSwarm will automatically use the new features. Traditional AI tools are frozen at their training cutoff."

---

### If Asked: "Can I see the actual code generated?"

**Answer + Demo**:
```bash
# Show code output
cat output/pattern_003/implementation.py

# Beautiful, well-commented, production-ready code appears
```

**What You Say**:
