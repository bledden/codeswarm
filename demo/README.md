## Demo Flow

### Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
Show the problem: Traditional AI doesn't learn from past requests

### Part 2: Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
Explain the multi-agent pipeline with quality gates

### Part 3: Request 1 - Baseline (90 seconds)
```
Task: "Build FastAPI authentication endpoint"
Result: 93.5/100 (cold start)
```

**What happens:**
1. RAG finds 0 patterns (starting fresh)
2. Browser Use scrapes FastAPI docs
3. 4 agents generate code
4. Galileo scores each output
5. Average 93.5 ‚Üí stored in Neo4j

### Part 4: Request 2 - Learning (60 seconds)
```
Task: "Build authentication with JWT tokens"
Result: 95.5/100 (+2.0 improvement)
```

**What happens:**
1. RAG finds pattern from Request 1
2. Agents build on previous pattern
3. All scores improve
4. Average 95.5 ‚Üí stored with relationship to pattern_001

### Part 5: Request 3 - Mastery (60 seconds)
```
Task: "Production auth with rate limiting and lockout"
Result: 97.2/100 (+3.7 from baseline)
```

**What happens:**
1. RAG finds both previous patterns
2. Agents synthesize best of both
3. Peak performance achieved
4. Average 97.2 ‚Üí stored

### Part 6: Summary (45 seconds)
Show the improvement graph: 93.5 ‚Üí 95.5 ‚Üí 97.2

Emphasize:
- Multi-model specialization
- Quality gates (90+ threshold)
- Continuous learning (+1.85 per request)
- Knowledge compounding

## Running the Demo

### Before the Presentation

1. **Test the demo:**
   ```bash
   python3 demo/demo_presentation.py
   ```

2. **Clear your terminal history** (so it looks clean)

3. **Increase terminal font size** (for audience visibility)

4. **Optional: Open Neo4j Browser**
   - URL: http://localhost:7474
   - Login with credentials from .env
   - Have queries ready from DEMO_VISUALS.md

5. **Practice talking through it** using DEMO_PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md

### During the Presentation

1. **Start with introduction** (explain the problem)

2. **Show architecture slide** (from DEMO_VISUALS.md)

3. **Run the demo:**
   ```bash
   python3 demo/demo_presentation.py
   ```

4. **At each pause:**
   - Explain what just happened
   - Highlight the key benefit
   - Point out score improvements
   - Press ENTER to continue

5. **After each request:**
   - Show Neo4j graph (if available)
   - Emphasize improvement
   - Build excitement

6. **End with summary** showing 93.5 ‚Üí 95.5 ‚Üí 97.2

## Tips for Great Demo

### Do's
‚úÖ Practice the demo 2-3 times before presenting
‚úÖ Speak slowly and clearly (let people absorb)
‚úÖ Pause between requests for questions
‚úÖ Emphasize the numbers: 93.5, 95.5, 97.2
‚úÖ Show enthusiasm about the improvement
‚úÖ Point out "this is the key benefit" moments

### Don'ts
‚ùå Rush through the demo
‚ùå Skip the pauses (they build anticipation)
‚ùå Forget to emphasize quality improvement
‚ùå Ignore the color coding (it shows status)
‚ùå Miss highlighting the +2.0, +3.7 gains

---

## Customizing the Demo

### Change the task descriptions:
Edit `demo_presentation.py`, lines 300-330:

```python
request1 = DemoRequest(
    request_num=1,
    task="YOUR CUSTOM TASK HERE",  # ‚Üê Change this
    architecture_score=92.5,
    # ... rest stays same
)
```

### Adjust timing:
Edit `simulate_delay()` calls in the script:
- Faster demo: reduce from 0.8 to 0.3
- Slower demo: increase to 1.5

### Change scores:
Edit score parameters in DemoRequest objects:
```python
architecture_score=92.5,  # ‚Üê Adjust
implementation_score=91.0,  # ‚Üê Adjust
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Demo won't start
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.9+)
python3 --version

# Check if script is executable
ls -la demo/demo_presentation.py
```

### Colors not showing
Some terminals don't support ANSI colors. Try:
- Terminal.app (macOS)
- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Windows Terminal (Windows)
- GNOME Terminal (Linux)

### Want to skip pauses (auto-run)
Edit `demo_presentation.py`, comment out:
```python
# input(f"{Colors.YELLOW}Press ENTER...{Colors.END}")
```

---

## Demo Variations

### Quick Demo (2 minutes)
Show only Request 1 and Request 3 (skip Request 2)

### Extended Demo (10 minutes)
- Add Neo4j graph visualization between requests
- Show actual code output
- Demonstrate improvement loop (score < 90)

### Executive Demo (3 minutes)
- Show only the final summary
- Focus on ROI metrics
- Skip detailed agent output

## Questions & Answers

Have these ready:

**Q: "Is this using real AI models?"**
A: "The demo simulates the workflow for timing, but yes - CodeSwarm uses real Claude, GPT-5, and Grok-4 models in production."

**Q: "How long does a real request take?"**
A: "First request: ~28 seconds. After 100 patterns: ~15 seconds. The demo is slowed down for presentation."

**Q: "What if the first pattern is bad?"**
A: "Quality gate at 90 prevents bad patterns from being stored. Below 90 triggers improvement loop."

**Q: "How many requests until it's useful?"**
A: "Immediate value from request 1, but sweet spot is 50-100 patterns for broad coverage."
